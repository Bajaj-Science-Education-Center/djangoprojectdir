<div class="general">

  <p>Biology laboratory conducts experiments and activities based on Botany, Zoology, Human biology, Plant physiology, Biochemistry, cell biology, earth sciences for students with the help of which they can get core understanding in this dynamic subject of life science. Students work individually or in small groups on a question, problem or hypothesis. They use the processes and materials of science to construct their own explanation of biological phenomena. They observe, collect data and interpret data of life processes and living organisms.
