  <h1><strong>Why is the Bajaj Science Center Important?</strong></h1>
  <p>The Bajaj Science Education Centre encourages children to discover and explore science through hands-on experimentation,
     which is largely missing in school curricula. It does this through laboratory sessions held in five laboratories, 
     each dedicated to a different branch of science.</p>

  <h1><strong>How does Bajaj Science Education Centre impart learning to students?</strong></h1>
  <p>Students are admitted to Bajaj Science Education Centre through entrance exams held at the 5th and 7th standard levels. The Centre facilitates about 500 students in carrying out concept-oriented experiments and demonstrations, which stimulate their curiosity and introduces them to the method of science. They also conduct experiments related to their school curriculum. Students are encouraged to ask questions, explain concepts and undertake projects - all of which help learning. Some of them are mentored for participation in National level competitive exams and other competitions.
