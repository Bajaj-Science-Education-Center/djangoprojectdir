<div class="general">
<p>Mathematics Laboratory is a place where anybody can perform experiments (activities) and explore their ideas. It is a place where one will find a collection of games, puzzles and other teaching and learning materials. The material is meant to be used by both the students on their own and with their teacher to explore the world of mathematics, to discover, to learn and to develop an interest in mathematics. The activities and puzzles in the maths laboratory appealing to a wide range of people of different ages. These activities are intended to give children an experience of doing mathematics and not merely for the purpose of demonstration. The lab method is a method of teaching children in small groups. The children move around, discuss, choose their required materials, and can do the activities individually.
  The exposure camps and workshops help students to appear for different competitive exams like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bhaskaracharya Mathematics Talent Search Competition (BMTSC)</li>
    <li>National Mathematics Talent Contest (NMTC)</li>
    <li>Pre-regional Mathematics Olympiad (PRMO)</li>
    <li>Indian Olympiad Qualifier in Mathematics (IOQM)</li>
  </ul>
